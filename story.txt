Jackson was a security guard for the museum, working the graveyard shift. There
was never much to do and he was always on the verge of falling asleep. One night,
he had taken a quick nap when he was suddenly jolted awake by a thudding sound
down the hall. Eager to investigate, he made his way towards where the sound
had come from, and shone his light into the Ancient Egypt exhibit. There, he saw
that the exhibit had been ransacked and the mummy was gone.

He immediately thought of looking at the video from monitor camera.He saw no one had
ever entered the exhibit besides himself.This confused him and he started thinking hard
what could possibly happened. Then he heard a voice.                       Linyi   

The voice seemed to be of a younger man.  This was confusing because no one was
 on the security videos.  Whos coice could it have been.  What does the voice mean?
