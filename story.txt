Jackson was a security guard for the museum, working the graveyard shift. There
was never much to do and he was always on the verge of falling asleep. One night,
he had taken a quick nap when he was suddenly jolted awake by a thudding sound
down the hall. Eager to investigate, he made his way towards where the sound
had come from, and shone his light into the Ancient Egypt exhibit. There, he saw
that the exhibit had been ransacked and the mummy was gone.

He immediately thought of looking at the video from monitor camera.He saw no one had
ever entered the exhibit besides himself.This confused him and he started thinking hard
what could possibly happened. Then he heard a voice.                        Linyi

He tried to follow the voice, but it seemed that he couldn't track it down anywhere,
as if it were emanating from the building itself. It spoke something clearly human,
but not from any language he had ever heard. After several minutes of searching, it 
became clear that the voice was coming from outside. Just out the front door, he saw
as a human figure was enveloped into the ground, as if the earth were 
completely fluid.                                                           Menzia
